Oops I Spent Again is a student expense tracker designed to help students record and reflect on daily spending—from food trips, commutes, dates, and budol treats to after-school gala and random small purchases. It promotes mindful budgeting, encourages saving, and allows users to assess their daily habits to better manage their allowance.
